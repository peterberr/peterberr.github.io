I do research on anthropogenic activities linked to climate change, and on decarboninsation pathways. 

My research to date has three main themes: 
 - Life Cycle Analysis of energy systems
 - Sources and drivers of energy demand and emissions, and decarbonisation pathways for residential buidling in the United States
 - Integrated analysis of energy and emissions from buildings and transport sectors, connected by their joint dependence on urban form.

Further information on each research theme can be found in the Projects and Publications pages
